did you know, that during World War II, there was a man named Jan Baalsrud, and his story is just insane! He was a member of a Norwegian resistance group that was ambushed by the Germans in 1943. Baalsrud was the only survivor of the group, but he was severely injured and had to leave behind his shoes and most of his clothing to escape. Despite the harsh winter conditions, he managed to evade the Germans and make his way through the mountains to neutral Sweden, losing all his toes due to frostbite. He was helped by the local people and also by the resistance groups. He eventually made it to safety and lived to tell his story. His journey was later portrayed in the Norwegian film "Nine Lives"
