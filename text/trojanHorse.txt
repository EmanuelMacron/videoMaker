Have you heard about the story how Greeks outsmarted Trojans in The Trojan war? The Trojan War was a war fought between the city of Troy and the Greeks, which is said to have taken place in the late Bronze Age. The cause of the war, according to Homer's epic poem the "Iliad," was the abduction of Helen, the wife of King Menelaus of Sparta, by Paris, a prince of Troy.

The Greeks, led by Agamemnon, assembled a massive army and set sail for Troy. The Trojan army, led by Hector, fought fiercely to defend their city, but the Greeks had the advantage of the legendary warrior Achilles on their side. The Trojan War lasted for 10 years, with many great heroes and warriors fighting on both sides.

One of the most famous events of the Trojan War was the Trojan Horse. The Greeks had been unable to enter the city of Troy, so they built a giant wooden horse and left it outside the city gates, pretending to sail away. The Trojans believed that the horse was a gift and brought it inside the city walls. However, the horse was filled with Greek soldiers, who emerged at night and opened the city gates, allowing the rest of the Greek army to enter and sack the city.

The Trojan War ended with the defeat of Troy and the destruction of the city. Many of the Trojan warriors, including Hector, were killed, and the surviving citizens were taken as slaves. The story of the Trojan War is still told today as a cautionary tale about the horrors of war and the dangers of hubris.
