Have you heard about this United States war crime! The "Kabul Drone Strike" took place on 29 August 2021 in Afghanistan and killed 10 civilians, including 7 children, who were later found to be aid workers. The US initially claimed that the targeted vehicle was an ISIS safe house but later confirmed it was a Toyota Corolla carrying civilians. Despite the mistake, no US personnel faced disciplinary action. The attack happened after the fall of Kabul and amid the belief of imminent attacks from ISIS. The US military acknowledged its mistake after reviewing footage, and in September 2021, General Kenneth McKenzie accepted responsibility for the killings. The Pentagon offered monetary compensation to the families of the victims, but the decision not to take disciplinary action was criticized. In January 2022, a group of 50 US legislators called for a review of military practices in drone strikes, citing that too many have led to unintended civilian deaths. Secretary of Defense Lloyd Austin addressed civilian casualties in drone strikes and asked for a plan to address it within 90 days.
