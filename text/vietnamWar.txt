Have you heard about this US war crime? The Phoenix Program was a counter-insurgency operation during the Vietnam War that was designed and initially coordinated by the CIA. The program aimed to identify and destroy the Viet Cong by using methods such as infiltration, capture, interrogation, and assassination. It was active from 1967 to 1972 and involved the American, Australian, and South Vietnamese militaries. During the program, 81,740 people were "neutralized", of whom 26,369 were killed, while the rest were captured or surrendered. The program was criticized for its use of torture, the number of neutral civilians killed, and being exploited for personal politics. Despite the criticism, the program was successful in suppressing Viet Cong activities. Public disclosure led to hearings by the US Congress and the CIA was eventually pressured to shut it down. A similar program, Plan F-6, continued under the South Vietnamese government.
