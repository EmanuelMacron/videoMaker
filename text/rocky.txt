Sylvester Stallone, the actor known for his portrayal of Rocky Balboa and John Rambo, wrote the script for the first Rocky movie in just three days.
He sold the script for $75,000, but insisted on playing the lead role, which led to a difficult journey to get the movie produced.
The movie went on to earn $225 million at the box office and won the Academy Award for Best Picture.
Stallone also wrote and starred in all of the Rocky sequels and the Rambo franchise.
