Without Igor Gouzenko, cold war could have never even happened. In 1945, Gouzenko was a cipher clerk at the Soviet Embassy in Ottawa, Canada. One day, he defected to the West and brought with him 109 documents that revealed a widespread Soviet spy network in North America, involving not only diplomats but also scientists and government officials.

Gouzenko's defection caused a sensation and sparked a major political scandal, leading to the arrest and conviction of several people, including a Canadian MP. It also played a significant role in the development of the Cold War, as it provided concrete evidence of Soviet espionage activities and increased tensions between the West and the Soviet Union.

Despite receiving protection from the Canadian government, Gouzenko and his family lived in constant fear of Soviet retaliation. They were eventually resettled in a secret location in the United States, where they lived under assumed names until Gouzenko's death in 1982.

Gouzenko's defection remains one of the most significant events in the history of Soviet espionage, and is often considered a turning point in the early stages of the Cold War.
