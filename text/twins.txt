You will not believe this crazy coincidence! In 1849, two men named Robert Campbell and Robert Smith independently decided to open stores on the same street in San Francisco. Both men had similar tastes in decor and even ended up buying the same set of furniture for their stores. They also decided to name their stores "R. Campbell" and "R. Smith." Eventually, they found out about each other and decided to merge their stores and name it "Campbell & Smith." Years later, they discovered that they were both born on the same day, in the same year, in the same small town in Ohio, and even had the same parents. They had been separated at birth and had unknowingly been reunited through their business venture in San Francisco. For more crazy stories, check my profile!
