The "Christmas Bombings" of 1972 were a series of intense air raids carried out by US forces during the Vietnam War in an effort to pressure the North Vietnamese government to negotiate a peace settlement. The raids lasted for 11 days and targeted major cities and military installations across North Vietnam, causing significant damage and casualties. The raids were heavily criticized by many countries and international organizations, who called for an immediate ceasefire. The bombings ultimately failed to achieve their objective and were seen as a turning point in the war, leading to a shift in public opinion against US involvement in the conflict.
