Have you heard about The Banana Wars! It was a series of military interventions in Central America and the Caribbean by the United States, from 1898 to 1934. The nickname came about because many of the countries in the region were major producers of bananas, which were becoming increasingly popular in the US.

One of the most unusual incidents from this period occurred in Honduras in 1924. US Marines were sent to the country to protect American banana plantations and other business interests. While there, they found themselves in the middle of a conflict between two rival political factions, each claiming to be the legitimate government of Honduras.

One faction, led by a General Tiburcio Carías Andino, was holed up in a fortress-like building called the "White House." The Marines laid siege to the building, bombarding it with artillery and cutting off supplies. But despite their efforts, General Carías refused to surrender.

That's when the Marines came up with a daring plan: they would send a small team of soldiers, disguised as women, to sneak into the building and capture the General. The plan worked, and General Carías was taken into custody. He was so embarrassed by his capture that he refused to leave his cell until he was given a fresh suit of clothes and a shave.
