When did Mark Zukerberg make his first million? He started Facebook in 2004 while he was a student at Harvard University. Initially, the site was only available to college students, but it quickly spread to other universities and eventually to the general public. By 2005, Facebook had over 5 million users and was rapidly growing.

In 2006, Mark and his co-founders sold a 1.6% stake in Facebook for $12.7 million to venture capital firm Accel Partners. This was Mark's first million dollars, and it came with Mark being just 23 years of age.

Mark's net worth is now over 100 billion dollars, making him one of the richest men in the world.
