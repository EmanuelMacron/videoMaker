Did you know! That in 2003, a man named David Hartley was on a vacation to Mexico with his wife Tiffany. They decided to take a ride on Jet Skis on Falcon lake, which straddles the border between Mexico and United States. As they were riding, they suddenly heard gunshots, and saw several armed men on the Mexican side of the lake. David was shot in the head and killed, while Tiffany barely managed to escape back to the united states.

After the incident, Mexican authorities claimed that the Hartleys had stumbled upon a drug trafficking operation and that David had been killed in a crossfire. However, Tiffany insisted that they had been targeted by the gunmen and that it was a premeditated attack. The case garnered international attention and remains shrouded in mystery to this day, with some people speculating that David's death was connected to the illegal drug trade in the area.
