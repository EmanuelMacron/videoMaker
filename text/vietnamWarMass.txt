Did you know that The My Lai Massacre occurred on March 16, 1968, in the village of My Lai in South Vietnam. US soldiers from Charlie Company, 11th Brigade, Americal Division entered the village and began a killing spree that lasted for several hours. According to reports, between 347 and 504 unarmed Vietnamese civilians were killed, including women, children, and the elderly. Some of the victims were subjected to sexual assault and torture.

The massacre was initially covered up by US military officials, but eventually came to light through investigative journalism and public outrage. Several soldiers from Charlie Company were eventually charged with crimes related to the massacre, including murder, assault, and dereliction of duty. However, only one soldier, Lieutenant William Calley, was convicted and sentenced to life in prison for his role in the massacre. He was later released on parole after serving three and a half years.

The My Lai Massacre is widely considered a war crime and a stain on US military history
