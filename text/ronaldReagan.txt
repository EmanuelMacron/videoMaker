How USA destroyed its reputation in 1980s! This is the story of The Iran-Contra Affair was a political scandal in the United States that came to light in 1986. It involved the sale of arms to Iran (which was under an arms embargo), with the proceeds being illegally used to fund anti-Sandinista rebels (known as Contras) in Nicaragua, despite a Congressional ban.

The affair began in 1985, when President Ronald Reagan's administration began secretly selling arms to Iran in an attempt to secure the release of American hostages being held by Iranian-backed terrorists in Lebanon. Reagan's National Security Council staff, led by Lieutenant Colonel Oliver North, arranged the sale of arms to Iran through intermediaries, with the proceeds being funneled to the Contras.

The scandal came to light in 1986, when it was revealed that North and other members of the Reagan administration had been diverting proceeds from the arms sales to the Contras. An investigation was launched, and several high-ranking officials, including North, were convicted of charges related to the affair.

The Iran-Contra Affair had a significant impact on the Reagan administration and on American politics as a whole. It damaged the reputation of the Reagan White House and led to a loss of public trust in the government. It also resulted in changes to laws and regulations governing the sale of arms and the funding of foreign conflicts, with the aim of preventing similar scandals in the future.
