Have you heard about the weird story of the Winchester Mystery House? The house was built by Sarah Winchester, the widow of gun manufacturer William Winchester. After her husband and child passed away, Sarah consulted a medium who told her that she was being haunted by the spirits of those killed by Winchester rifles. The medium advised her to move west and continuously build onto her home in order to confuse and evade the spirits.

Sarah took this advice to heart and moved to San Jose, California. She began construction on her home in 1884 and continued building for 38 years until her death in 1922. The result was a bizarre and sprawling mansion with 160 rooms, including secret passageways, staircases that lead to nowhere, doors that open to blank walls, and windows overlooking other rooms. The house also had a variety of architectural styles, as Sarah would frequently change her mind about the design.

The house became a popular tourist attraction after Sarah's death, and is still open to visitors today. It has been estimated that if all the lumber used in the construction of the house were laid end to end, it would stretch for more than a mile. Some people believe that the house is truly haunted by the spirits that Sarah was trying to evade, while others believe that the eccentric design of the house was simply a result of Sarah's grief and eccentricity. Regardless of the reason, the Winchester Mystery House is an intriguing and mysterious piece of American history.
