Do you beleive that Russia commited this war crime? The Alkhan-Yurt massacre was a December 1999 incident in which Russian troops under the command of General Vladimir Shamanov killed and abused civilians in the village of Alkhan-Yurt near Grozny, Chechen capital. Villagers claimed that 41 civilians were killed, while human rights groups confirmed 17 incidents of murder and 3 incidents of rape. The massacre was not an isolated incident, as Russian troops were reportedly systematically looting villages and towns under their control, as reported by Human Rights Watch. The soldiers in Alkhan-Yurt expelled and then killed civilians, burned and looted the village, and acted with impunity for more than two weeks. The looting was systematic and organized, involving many soldiers and possibly the knowledge of Russian commanders. Initially, the Russian Defense Ministry denied the massacre, but later found looted goods, including some splattered with blood. The villagers and pro-Moscow Chechen leaders identified the soldiers as Major-General Vladimir Shamanov's unit. Despite his role in the abuses, Shamanov was awarded Russia's highest honor, the Hero of Russia medal, by President Boris Yeltsin. The promised investigation was closed by the military for lack of evidence.
