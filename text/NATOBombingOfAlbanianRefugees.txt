Have you heard about this United States war crime! On April 14th, 1999, during NATO's bombing of Yugoslavia, 73 Kosovo Albanian refugees were killed in the bombing near Gjakova. The incident took place along a twelve-mile stretch of road between the towns of Gjakova and Decan in western Kosovo. Among the victims were 16 children.

Initially, NATO and the US claimed that only a military convoy was targeted and that Yugoslav forces might have attacked the civilians. However, two days later, NATO admitted that its planes had mistakenly bombed civilian vehicles. American media reporters who visited the scene saw evidence of damaged farm tractors, burned refugee bodies, bomb craters, and shrapnel. NATO first claimed to have targeted military vehicles, then reported that an American F-16 pilot had fired on what he believed were military trucks. NATO expressed deep regret for the mistake. Three Serbian policemen were also reported killed in the attack by Tanjug.
